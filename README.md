Salary Prediction Using Job Title

This project demonstrates a machine learning model to predict salaries based on job titles. It explores the relationship between job titles and salary ranges, using various machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.

Project Overview

The notebook contains steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The key goal is to accurately predict salaries given a set of job titles, leveraging machine learning techniques such as regression.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing data and preparing the dataset for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Transforming categorical variables (job titles) for model input.

Model Training: Using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and others.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
